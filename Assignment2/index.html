<h3>Chapter 1. </h3>
    <p>
    We meet Huckleberry Finn. He is a wild kid who would rather live by his own rules than those of anyone else. This does not sit well with the Widow Douglas who tries to keep him in line. Huck often causes trouble and sneaks out at night.

<h3>Chapter 2. </h3>
    <p>
        We meet some of Huck's friends. They are Tom's Sawyer's gang, a group of other kids who don't always follow the rules. They make an oath to be a band of robbers and killers, but they are not actually robbers or killers and never really cause much trouble. This is too dull for Huck, he needs more adventure.
