<h3>Chapter 2. </h3>

        We meet some of Huck's friends. They are Tom's Sawyer's gang, a group of other kids who don't always follow the rules. They make an oath to be a band of robbers and killers, but they are not actually robbers or killers and never really cause much trouble. This is too dull for Huck, he needs more adventure.
