# Huckleberry Finn

## Mark Twain

  Huck Finn has been one of my favorite books since I was very young. The way it shows that following your heart and doing what you believe is right is more important that going along with the rules of society. 

  This week was not too difficult, I just had to focus on getting all the correct steps completed. I probably could have added more stlye but I just wanted to keep the page readable.
